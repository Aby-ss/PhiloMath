👩🏻‍🔬  - What come's easy doesn't last, What lasts doesn't come easy


## Problem faced ❓
In my experience as a student, I always had trouble with math websites. Math websites only provide you with an indicayion of wether your answer is correct or not, and/or explain the correct solution without clarification on what you did wrong. As a reseult, this may prove ineffective in the long run as you never really understand why and where you ade the error

## My solution 📄
Philomath is a math application that is personalized with expectional feautuers. It relies on Artificial Intelligence called limited memory, and uses it to provide effective feedback on every solution to a quetion given by the user.
